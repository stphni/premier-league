### Data Set
Using the Python library called *BeautifulSoup*, data from the website: [FBref](https://fbref.com/en/) was scraped and parsed to create the data frames needed to begin analyzing the 21/22 season statistics. 

The data was cleaned and columns were added to ensure the most relevant data was utilized. The Pandas library, as well as NumPy, matplotlib, and Seaborn, were applied in order to perform calculations and create data visualization charts. The following categories were analyzed: 

- Goals For/Against
- Goal Difference
- xG vs Actual Goals Scored
- xG/90 vs Actual Goals per 90
